 the tiled layer. The goal of this is to prevent "flashing" on the screen while
 the tiled layer is re-drawn, as CATiledLayer will clear the tile before re-drawing.
 Note this only works when this view has a UIScrollView ancestor view. The snapshots
 are automatically discarded after a short time, under the assumption the CATiledLayer
 will have completed its redrawing of the tiles beneath the snapshots.
