 Callback when rendering content for a single tile in an overall tiled view.
 This may be called by a background thread. The layer might be sized for just
 a single tile, or it might be the same dimensions as theView; use @c theView
 for calculating all world dimensions, etc. The context's clip bounds will
 determine the frame of the tile within the overall content.
 
 @param theView The view supporting the tiled layer.
 @param layer   The layer being drawn.
 @param context The drawing context.
